# ðŸš€ Key Features

- WorkManager Integration:
Schedules and manages background tasks, such as data synchronization or long-running operations, ensuring they run efficiently and persistently.

- Dependency Injection with Hilt:
Simplifies dependency injection, providing a consistent and easy way to manage dependencies across the app, including within Workers.

- Background Processing:
Demonstrates how to enqueue, chain, and monitor background tasks using WorkManager while injecting dependencies with Hilt.
